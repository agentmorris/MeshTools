 CHAI Example: 06_board_tester

 Author: Federico Barbagli

****/

This example shows how to use the I/O boards that are supported in chai,
the Sensoray626 and the Servotogo ISA board. The demo let's you read from
encoders and or write values to DACs. In order to use this example, and
either
of the supported boards, you will need to have properly installed them.
To install Sensoray 626 boards visit the Sensoray web site at
http://www.sensoray.com/
To install Servotogo boards visit the Servotogo web site at
http://www.servotogo.com/
Note: in order to use the Servotogo board from Windows XP we rely on a
library called DLPortIO. You will need to install such library
in order to be able to access the Servotogo card.

Relevant items to look at in the code are :

* 06_board_testerDlg.cpp is the main application file, which includes
  initialization and main commands to the boards.

  A cGenericDevice is created and then is used to point to a specific
  board that you decide to pick from the GUI. Pressing on any of the encoder
  buttons will poll from the relative encoder channel from the selected board.
  The Slider Value to DACs will send the amount of volts selected through the
  slider on the GUI to ALL the DACs. This is limited between -10 and 10 Volts.
