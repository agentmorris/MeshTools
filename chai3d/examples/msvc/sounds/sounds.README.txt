 CHAI Example: sounds
 
 Author: Chris Sewell

****/

This example generates sounds based on frequencies, amplitudes,
and decay coefficients from a data file, convolved with the
haptic normal force, based on the algorithm
by Kies Van den Doel K and Dinesh Pai in "The sounds of
physical shapes". Presence 1998, 7(4): 382-395, and
"The AHI: An Audio and Haptic Interface For Contact
Interactions" by DiFilippo and Pai.  Sample data files for 
a bell and a teapot are in this directory.

It uses the BASS audio library, http://www.un4seen.com/. The
bass.dll, bass.h, and bass.lib files are included in this
directory.

Since it uses callbacks for the haptics, it is currently only 
compatible for use with a Phantom device.
