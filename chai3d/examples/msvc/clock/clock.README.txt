 CHAI Example: 08_clock
 
 Author: Chris Sewell

****/

This example demonstrates the functionalities of the
build-in CHAI clock.  Pressing the Start button starts
the clock; pressing Stop stops it; and pressing Init
resets it to zero.  Once the timeout interval (specified
in the code) is exceeded, a "Timeout" message appears 
in the bottom right corner.

This simple example illustrates how to create, 
initialize, start, and stop a clock, and how to set
and check for timeouts.
